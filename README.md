# The Light Matrix Escape

The Integrative Project of Team 404 consists in a light maze game where the player will face multiple levels with different degrees of difficulty. The project is based on the concept of reflection and refraction, where mirrors, walls, a light source, light detector, and door will be found in each level. In each level, the player will have to illuminate the light detector to open the door and escape the maze. Certain levels will even include prisms and will require the user to use a specific colour to open the door.
