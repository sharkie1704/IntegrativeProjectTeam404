# The Light Matrix Escape
By Ishrak Mellah, Daisy Li, and Ntela Bianda

The Integrative Project of Team 404 consists in a light maze game where the player will face multiple levels with different degrees of difficulty. The project is based on the concepts of reflection and refraction, where mirrors, walls, a light source, light detector, and door will be found. In each level, the player will have to illuminate the light detector to open the door and escape the maze. Certain levels will even include prisms and will require the user to use a specific colour to open the door.
